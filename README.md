## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gary and I create PHP related courses on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA2dkCp5DZj7HE0-6IX5ZHQ) and at [garyclarke.tech](https://www.garyclarke.tech)

#### What will you find here?

Mostly the repos from my courses. The most useful ones will be the ones that people have forked or starred. I now try to create one branch per lesson so most of my recent repos have quite a lot of branches and usually with useful names related to a prticular concept I wanna demo.

Feel free to have a look around...some of it could be better organized. I've only recently started getting on top of my readme files...fell free to send a PR if you wanna add or improve any ðŸ˜‚

I'm currently working on [PHP API Pro](https://www.garyclarke.tech/p/php-api-pro) ..learn all about how to create APIs in PHP by building an Airline API with me. 

You can check out that repo here ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/GaryClarke/php-api-pro

You might also find a few beginners projects here and there where I've been learning other languages and technologies. 

Currently learning Rust!
